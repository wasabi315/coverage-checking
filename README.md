# coverage-check

This repository contains an Agda formalization of one of the coverage checking algorithms for pattern matching presented in the paper "Warnings for pattern matching" by Luc Maranget.

Specifically, we formalize the usefulness checking algorithm $\mathcal{U}_\text{rec}$ presented in Section 3.1 and the exhaustiveness checking algorithm built on top of it.
We prove that a pattern matrix is indeed exhaustive if the algorithm returns `true`, and that there exists a sequence of values that are not covered if the algorithm returns `false`.
This formalization is compatible with agda2hs, allowing us to extract readable Haskell code from it!

Tested with Agda v2.7.0, agda-stdlib v2.0, and agda2hs 39e9b0c.
